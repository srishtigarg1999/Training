1.What is PostgreSQL?
  *It is a powerful,open source object-relational database system.
  *It has more than 15 years of active development and a proven architecture that has earned it a strong reputation for reliability, data integrity, and correctness.

2.A Brief History of PostgreSQL
  *PostgreSQL,originally called Postgres,was created at UCB by a computer science professor named Michael Stonebraker.
  *Stonebraker started Postgres in 1986 as a follow-up project to its predecessor,Ingres,nowowned   by Computer Associates.

1977-1985-A project called INGRES as developed.
  *Proof-of-concept for relational databases
  *Established the company Ingres in 1980
  *Bought by Computer Associates in 1994.

1986-1994-POSTGRES
  *Development of the concepts in INGRES with a focus on object orientation and the query language-Quel
  *The code base of INGRES was not used a a basis of POSTGRES.
  *Commercialized as Illutra(Bought by Informix,bought by IBM)


1994-1995-Postgres95
  *Support for SQL was added in 1994.
  *Released as Postgres95 in 1995
  *Re-released as PostgresSQL 6.0 in 1996
  *Establishment of the PostgreSQL Global Development Team.

Key Features of PostgreSQL
  *PostgreSQL runs on all major operating systems, including Linux, UNIX (AIX, BSD, HP-UX, SGI IRIX, Mac OS X, Solaris, Tru64), and Windows. 
  *It supports text, images, sounds, and video, and includes programming interfaces for C / C++, Java, Perl, Python, Ruby, Tcl and Open Database Connectivity (ODBC).

PostgreSQL supports a large part of the SQL standard and offers many modern features including the following âˆ’

Complex SQL queries
SQL Sub-selects
Foreign keys
Trigger
Views
Transactions
Multiversion concurrency control (MVCC)
Streaming Replication (as of 9.0)
Hot Standby (as of 9.0)

3.Installation Of PostgreSQL
  *Command:-
   1. sudo apt-get update
   2. sudo apt-get upgrade
   3. sudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-contrib

4.Start PostgreSQL CLI
  *service postgresql-To check the status of postgreSQL.
   Output:-Usage: /etc/init.d/postgresql {start|stop|restart|reload|force-reload|status}    [version ..]
  *service postgresql status-Running status of postgreSQL
  *sudo su postgres-To login into postgres
  *psql-To enter into postgreSQL terminal
  *\q-To exit the PostgreSQL CLI.

5.In PostgreSQL CLI
