chmod [option] [permission] [file_name]

Reference   Class     Description
u          owner      file's owner

g          group      users who are members of
                      the file's group

o          others     users who are neither the
                      file's owner nor members of 
                      the file's group

a          all       All three of the above, same as ugo

Operator  Description
+         Adds the specified modes to the
          specified classes

-         Removes the specified modes from 
          the specified classes

=         The modes specified are to be made
          the exact modes for the specified 
          classes

r       Permission to read the file.
w       Permission to write (or delete) the file.
x       Permission to execute the file, or, in
        the case of a directory, search it.

ping
---->The ping command is one of the most used basic Linux commands for checking whether a network or a server is reachable. In addition, it is used to troubleshoot various connectivity issues.

Syntax:ping google.com

wget command
---->Used to download files from server or website.

Syntax:
wget http://example.com/sample.php

wget -b http://www.example.com/samplepage.php
---->To download the file in background.

wget --tries=10 http://example.com/samplefile.tar.gz
---->To try a given number of times.

chown command
---->It lets you change the ownership of a file, directory, or symbolic link to a specified username

Syntax:chown owner_name file_name

sudo command
---->It allows you to perform task that require administrative or root permissions.
---->When using sudo, the system will prompt users to authenticate themselves with a password. Then, the Linux system will log a timestamp as a tracker. By default, every root user can run sudo commands for 15 minutes/session.

sudo -V
---->Prints the version of sudo command.

sudo -l
---->The -l (list) option will print out the commands allowed (and forbidden) the user on the current host

-k or –reset-timestamp invalidates the timestamp file.
-g or –group=group runs commands as a specified group name or ID.
-h or –host=host runs commands on the host.

locate Linux.txt
---->give the path of the file where it is located.
beryl@beryl-Latitude-7490:~/Desktop$ locate Linux.txt
/home/beryl/Desktop/Beryl/Training/Linux.txt

locate -i Linux.txt
---->ignores case senstivity

find command
Use the find command to search for files within a specific directory and perform subsequent operations.


df command
---->Use the df command to report the system’s disk space usage, shown in percentage and kilobyte (KB). Here’s the general syntax:

df [options] [file]

For example, enter the following command if you want to see the current directory’s system disk space usage in a human-readable format:

df -h

These are some acceptable options to use:

df -m displays information on the file system usage in MBs.
df -k displays file system usage in KBs.
df -T shows the file system type in a new column.


du command
---->Shows how much space files and directories take up.

diff command
---->Short for difference, the diff command compares two contents of a file line by line. After analyzing them, it will display the parts that do not match.

---->Programmers often use the diff command to alter a program instead of rewriting the entire source code.

Here’s the general format:

diff [option] file1 file2

For example, you want to compare two text files – note.txt and note_update.txt:

diff note.txt note_update.txt

Here are some acceptable options to add:

-c displays the difference between two files in a context form.
-u displays the output without redundant information.
-i makes the diff command case insensitive.

job command
---->Display all the running processes along with their statuses
---->only available in csh, bash, tcsh, and ksh shells.
---->syntax:- jobs [options] jobID
---->-l lists process IDs along with their information.
---->-n lists jobs whose statuses have changed since the last notification.
---->-p lists process IDs only.

kill command
---->Use the kill command to terminate an unresponsive program manually.
---->To kill a program, you must know its process identification number (PID)
    • don’t know the PID. syntax:- ps ux
    • syntax :- kill SIGKILL 63773
---->SIGTERM requests a program to stop running and gives it some time to save all of its progress. The system will use this by default if you don’t specify the signal when entering the kill command.
---->SIGKILL forces programs to stop, and you will lose unsaved progress.

uname command
---->The uname or unix name command will print detailed information about your Linux system and hardware. This includes the machine name, operating system, and kernel. To run this command, simply enter uname into your CLI.
-a prints all the system information.
-s prints the kernel name.
-n prints the system’s node hostname.

top command
---->The top command in Linux Terminal will display all the running processes and a dynamic real-time view of the current system. 
---->It sums up the resource utilization, from CPU to memory usage.

history command
---->the system will list up to 500 previously executed commands, allowing you to reuse them without re-entering.
---->Keep in mind that only users with sudo privileges can execute this command. How this utility runs also depends on which Linux shell you use.

-c clears the complete history list.
-d offset deletes the history entry at the OFFSET position.
-a appends history lines.

echo
---->The echo command is a built-in utility that displays a line of text or string using the standard output. 
Syntax:
echo “Hostinger Tutorials”

zip command
---->Use the zip command to compress your files into a ZIP file, a universal format commonly used on Linux. 
---->It can automatically choose the best compression ratio.

Syntax:
zip archive.zip note.txt

For unzip:
unzip archive.zip

hostname command
---->Run the hostname command to know the system’s hostname. 

-a or –alias displays the hostname’s alias.
-A or –all-fqdns displays the machine’s Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN).
-i or –ip-address displays the machine’s IP address.

useradd command
---->useradd is used to create a new account
---->Only those with root privileges or sudo can run the useradd command.

useradd John
userdel username

apt-get command
---->apt-get is a command line tool for handling Advanced Package Tool (APT) libraries in Linux. 
----> It lets you retrieve information and bundles from authenticated sources to manage, update, remove, and install software and its dependencies.
---->Running the apt-get command requires you to use sudo or root privileges.

These are the most common commands you can add to apt-get:

---->update synchronizes the package files from their sources.
---->upgrade installs the latest version of all installed packages.
---->check updates the package cache and checks broken dependencies.

alias
---->alias allows you to create a shortcut with the same functionality as a command, file name, or text. 
---->When executed, it instructs the shell to replace one string with another.

Syntax:
alias Name=String

Example:alias CD="cd Desktop"

unalias
---->To remove an existing alias.
unalias CD

Options for Alias command: 
-p option : This option prints all the defined aliases is reusable format.

su command
---->The switch user or su command allows you to run a program as a different user.

---->It changes the administrative account in the current log-in session.

---->This command is especially beneficial for accessing the system through SSH or using the GUI display manager when the root user is unavailable.

Here are some acceptable options to use:

-p or –preserve-environment keeps the same shell environment, consisting HOME, SHELL, USER, and LOGNAME.
-s or –shell lets you specify a different shell environment to run.
-l or –login runs a login script to switch to a different username. Executing it requires you to enter the user’s password.

htop command
---->The htop command is an interactive program that monitors system resources and server processes in real time.

ps command
---->The process status or ps command produces a snapshot of all running processes in your system. 
---->Executing the ps command without an option or argument will list the running processes in the shell along with:
      
The unique process ID (PID)
The type of the terminal (TTY)
The running time (TIME)
The command that launches the process (CMD)
